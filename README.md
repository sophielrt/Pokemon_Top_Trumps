# Battle Academy Pokémon Top Trumps
!!!!!Add website mock-ups here!

Battle Academy Pokémon Top Trumps is an interactive card game where the user competes against the computer using a Pokémon card. The website randomly selects a Pokémon from the first 898 in the [PokeAPi](https://pokeapi.co/), displaying their image and stats including ID, Speed, Attack, Defense, Height and Weight. The game tracks the score through 5 rounds, and at the end, asks the user if they would like to play again.

The site also features game instructions, social media buttons and a 404 page. However, this is only the first iteration of the Battle Academy Top Trumps Website - additional sections including High Scores, Enter Name, On Screen Winner, Loser or Draw animation will be added in the future.

### Design Choices 
!!!!!!Add design choice image here!

1. Typography
   - The Pokémon font by FontGet was selected for the main headings on the website because it closely replicates the original Pokémon logo style. Using this font for headings creates a fun, colourful, and nostalgic aesthetic that immediately engages users. Its distinctive style makes headings stand out and it resonates with both past Pokémon and present Pokémon fans by evoking familiarity and nostalgia.
   - The Pokémon GB Font by Jackster Productions was chosen for buttons and headings because it replicates the font used in the original Pokémon Game Boy games. This choice reinforces the nostalgic feel of the website, connecting users to the classic Pokémon experience while maintaining a playful aesthetic.
   - Roboto has been selected as the primary font for the website's content due to its modern, clean, and friendly visual tone, making it well-suited for displaying large amounts of text. It offers excellent legibility and high accessibility, while also being widely supported across all major browsers. Roboto's balanced design complements the playful Pokémon replica fonts and colourful aesthetic of the Website.
