# Battle Academy Pokemon Top Trumps
!!!!!Add website mock-ups here!

Battle Academy Pokemon Top Trumps is an interactive card game where the user competes against the computer using a pokemon card. The website randomly selects a Pokemon from the first 898 in the [PokeAPi](https://pokeapi.co/), displaying their image and stats including ID, Speed, Attack, Defense, Height and Weight. The game tracks the score through 5 rounds, and at the end, asks the user if they would like to play again.

The site also features game instructions, social media buttons and a 404 page. However, this is only the first iteration of the Battle Academy Top Trumps Website - additional sections including High Scores, Enter Name, On Screen Winner, Loser or Draw animation will be added in the future.
